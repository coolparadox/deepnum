coolparadox-number-reducer is a library for decomposing rational numbers into 
"continued log" components, as well as performing basic arithmetic operations
with rational numbers in continued log form.

The foundation of continued log arithmetic has been provided by Bill Gosper in
his paper "Continued Fraction Arithmetic"
