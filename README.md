This does nothing useful yet. Someday it'll handle arithmetic in [continued logarithm](https://perl.plover.com/classes/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt) format.

Continued logarithms is a way of representing rational numbers with unbounded precision.

dn-clarith is intended to be the foundation of a more ambitious (and so far poorly defined) project for offering arithmetic of rational numbers with on demand precision.
